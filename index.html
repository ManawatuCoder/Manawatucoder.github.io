          <h1>Hi, I am Ben Perkins - Welcome To My Porfolio Page</h1>
          <p>
            This portfolio has been created to showcase my abilities as a software developer, and give you an idea of who I am.
            
            <br><br>
            I have always been technology focused, with my sights mostly set on computers. I have been building websites 
            and modifying, or 'modding', video games since I was a child, and taught myself HTML at the age of twelve.
            Some time in early 2022 I realised I have enough understanding to, now, consider a career in I.T. and software.
            I have, since, been studying and building projects full time in an effort to learn and demonstrate the skills I 
            need to enter the field.
            
            <br><br>
            I have multiple embedded development projects utilising microcontrollers such as the ESP32, ESP8266, and STM32
            in automation and data-processing projects. As these are physical devices, I will upload videos of them working
            and display them on this portfolio.
